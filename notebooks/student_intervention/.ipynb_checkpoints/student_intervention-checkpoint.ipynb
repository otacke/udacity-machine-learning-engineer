    "We have a pretty small dataset with only 395 rows, and we will have to shrink it even more for creating a test set. In relation to the number of rows, we have quite a lot of features (30). In consequence, we will have to use a classification algorithm that can build a feasible model even given few training items and relatively many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we could assume that the school might collect data for more students in the future, and this would influence our choice for the algorithm as well. It needs to scale well CPU-wise if we use a parametric model and want to retrain - or memory-wise if we use a non-parametric model. Since there are no hints given in the assignment -- and the board of directors probably wants to see some numbers right now, we won't take this into account too much, but keep it in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classifier 1: Support Vector Machines\n",
    "#### real-world application\n",
    "Support Vector Machines seem to be used frequently in medical settings. For example, they're used to identify breast cancer ([Zheng, B., Yoon, S. W., & Lam, S. S. (2014). Breast cancer diagnosis based on feature extraction using a hybrid of K-means and support vector machine algorithms. Expert Systems with Applications, 41(4), 1476-1482.](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1016/j.eswa.2013.08.044)). SVMs are used in combination with a K-means algorithm. Using a 10-fold cross validation, this approach has 97.38% accuracy when tested on the [Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).\n",
    "SVMs are also used on MRI images to distinguish between Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal controls ([Zhang, Y., Wang, S., & Dong, Z. (2014). Classification of Alzheimer disease based on structural magnetic resonance imaging by kernel support vector machine decision tree. Progress In Electromagnetics Research, 144, 171-184.](http://jpier.org/PIER/pier144/16.13121310.pdf)). After all, this approach achieves 80% classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### strengths\n",
    "SVMs can be very effective in in high dimensional spaces. In fact, they can still be effective if the number of features is greater than the number of samples. Also, they can be used for many purposes: we can use the kernel trick to create non-linear decision boundaries in order to capture very complex patterns in the data. (cmp. [sklearn tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### weaknesses\n",
    "Unfortunately, as we have learned from Sebastian Thrun, SVMs don't perform well on large training data sets because of the rapid growth of computation time. Also, they are prone to overfitting if there's a lot of noise in the data. Finetuning this via different parameters can be tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### justification\n",
    "Using a support vector machine might be a good idea, because we only have a small dataset of a non-critical size. The [API page of sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html#sklearn.svm.SVC) reads \"hard to scale to dataset with more than a couple of 10000 samples\", and we are way below that. Also taking into account the relatively high number of features (compared to the sample size), a SVM might be benefitial. It should be able to create a feasible model given these circumstances.\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
